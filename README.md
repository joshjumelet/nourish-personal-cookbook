### _Getting Started_

### Users interact with the webpage via navigational options displayed in the upper right of the screen. Each link brings a user to a new page. Those selections are a Home, About, Recipes, and Create Recipes. Nourish is designed to allow a user to input their very own recipe and even add their own image of the final product. A user has a field to input the name, ingredients list and instructions for their specific recipe. Once added the user can review, update and even delete any recipe within their library. Users are able to then interact with existing recipes by adding a comment detailing their own experience creating the recipe and any useful information they'd like to see added!
